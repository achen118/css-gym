# CSS Gym - Exercise Your Knowledge of CSS Selectors
[CSS Gym live](https://achen118.github.io/css-gym/)

CSS Gym is a CSS tutorial inspired by CSS Diner. Consisting of 5 levels, each level provides a lesson on how to use basic CSS selectors. Inputting the correct CSS selector into the CSS Editor will advance you to the next level.

## Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features already implemented in CSS Gym, outlined below are the following steps I plan to take as I continue working on this project:

### Additional Levels & Gym Equipment
### More Detailed Hints

Currently, CSS Gym provides hints as you hover over specific gym equipment. These hints display the current CSS selector of the gym item that is being moused over. As I continue to work on CSS Gym, I plan to implement more detailed hints, most likely as pop-up modals, that will be available if a user needs additional help to pass a level.
