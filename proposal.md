# CSS Selectors

### Background

CSS Selectors is a CSS tutorial inspired by CSS Diner. Each level will provide CSS documentation and a lesson on how to use specific CSS selectors.

### Functionality & MVP

Each level will have the following:
- [ ] Sidebar displaying the level and a short lesson on a CSS selector (will allow users to change the level)
- [ ] CSS Editor that will accept user input
- [ ] HTML Viewer that displays the HTML that represents the images in the Selector Display element
- [ ] Selector Display that will animate the elements that are meant to be selected
- [ ] Selector Display elements on hover will highlight the corresponding HTML code in the HTML viewer
- [ ] If the element(s) is/are successfully selected by the user, they will animate and fly off screen, page will render the next level

Additionally:
- [ ] Production README

### Wireframes

CSS Selectors will be a single page application that will render the main element. The main element will render the sidebar, selector display, and editors elements.
